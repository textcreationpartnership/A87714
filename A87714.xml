            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113104:5"/> plainly prove it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.8, 9, 10. more fully manifested in <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Esai.</hi> 52.2. and more at large spoken of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. to the end; as also practised by the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> himself, in <hi>Acts</hi> 19.8, 9, 10. But now, <hi>Sin,</hi> here lies the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; If your Congregations be such, as where the Word and Sacraments are purely dispenced, then we sinne, and you justly charge us with Schisme, for separating from you, but if it be not so, that your Congregations are such, but on the contrary, even such as doe not dispense the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments purely, then we doe well, and you sinne in charging us with Schisme, in doing what the Word commands, and the Saints practised, and therefore wee having nothing to prove that the Word, and Sacraments are purely dispensed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, but your bare affirmation, it cannot satisfie our Consciences; and I marvell how it satisfieth yours: Doth not the Word of God, like a two-edged Sword fight against you?

                  <hi>QUERIE II.</hi> By what Scripture warrant doe you take upon you to erect now framed Congregations, seperated to the disturbance of the great Worke of Reformation now in hand?</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This querie hath in it these two parts, 1. That wee erect new framed Seperate Congregations. 2. Wee doe by this disturbe the great Worke of Reformation now in hand.</p>
               <p>To the first, it is well knowne to many, especially to our selves; that our Congregations were erected and framed as now they are, according to the Rule of Christ, before wee heard of any Reformation, even at that time when Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie was in the height of its vanishing glory (and wee are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, will remain in the despight of all cruelty) even when they were plotting and threatning the ruine of all those which opposed it, and wee hope you will not say, wee sinned in seperating from them, whose errors you now condemne, and yet, if you shall still continue to brand us with the names of <hi>Anabaptists, Schismaticks, Hereticks, &amp;c.</hi> for saving our selves from such a Generation, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40. as you your selves have cut-off, and from such a superstitious Worship, as you say shall be reformed; wee conceive it is your ignorance, or worse, and though you condemne us, Christ will justifie us,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113104:6"/> even by that Word of his, which he hath given us, and wee desire to practise, and have already commended to you in that conclusion of our Answer to the first querie.</p>
               <p>And for the second part of your querie, <hi>That wee disturbe the great Worke of Reformation now in hand;</hi> I know not what you meane by this charge, unlesse it be to discover your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice against us, in Reforming our selves before you, for as yet we have not in our understanding seen, neither can wee conceive any thing of that we shal see reformed by you accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Truth, but that through Mercie, wee enjoy the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the same already; 'tis strange this should be a distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance; to the ingenious faithfull Reformer; it should be, (one would think) a furtherance rather then a disturbance: and whereas you tell us of the worke of Reformation now in hand, no reasonable men will force us to desist from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of that which we are perswaded is according to Truth, and waite for that, which we know not what it will be; and in the meane time, practise that which you your selves say must be reformed: but whereas you tell us of a great Worke of Reformation, wee should intreat you to shew us wherein the greatnesse of it doth consist, for as yet wee see no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, unlesse it be in the vast expence of Money and Time: for what great thing is it to change <hi>Episcopacie</hi> into <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and a Book of <hi>Common Prayer</hi> into a <hi>Directory,</hi> and to exalt men from Livings of 100 l. a yeere, to places of 400 l. <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num:</hi> for I pray you consider, is there not the same power, the same Priests, the same People, the same Worship, and in the same manner still continued, but when wee shall see your great worke of Reformation to appeare, that you have fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med your Congregations according to that true &amp; unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Pattern, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9, 10, 11. according to the command of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. and the Apostles practise, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. and <hi>chap.</hi> 5.13, 14. and made all things suitable to the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, as <hi>Moses</hi> did, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.40. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5. you will see, I hope, that wee shall be so farre from disturbing that Worke, as that wee shall be one with it.</p>

Now then, if wee cannot keep faith and a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, in obeying all the Commands of Christ, so long as we assemble our selves with you, then are wee necessitated to seperate our selves from you, but that wee cannot keep faith and a good Conscience so with you, these Scriptures proves, compared with your practise, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. and 3.5. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.1. to the 14. with many other Scriptures, but in the mouth of two or three witnesses every truth shall stand; now then, so long as you denie to follow the rule of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and are not obedient to his commands, but reject the Word of God, which is given by Christ for the purging of the wicked from the godly, and the seperating the precious from the vile, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4.5.11.13. wee are bound in obedience to <hi>JESÆ²S CHRIST,</hi> to leave you, whilst you remaine obstinate to him, and joyne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and continue faithfull in the order of the Gospel.</p>

Now then, if we can prove our selves to be such Congregations as are before spoken of, or at leastwise, such as sincerely and truly strive, according to the light we have, to be such; then I hope you will be so farre from dispising such gatherings of the Saints together, as that you will not denie them to receive in members, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence such gifts for the edifying one of another, as the Lord hath given us, and this I shall labour to doe in the Answer to the next querie; and whereas you demand what warrant wee have to receive silly seduced Servants, &amp;c.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113104:9"/> well knowne to you, wee receive in none as members with us, but such as have been Members of your Church at the least sixteen, twenty or thirty yeers, and if they be silly when they are received Members amongst us, surely they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veilous silly when they were received members amongst you, and it should seem, they have received, by your own words, little Edification in their so long membership with you, and therefore it doth behove them, whom you say are so silly, to look out also where to be better instructed, who have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved so little benefit in so long time by your Ministery, lest they perish in their owne ignorance and blindnesse, and therefore herein you would doe well to take our Saviours advice, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.3, 4, 5. wee know it is no strange thing for those that desire to walke in the straight wayes of the Lord, to heare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves despised and reproached with these and farre greater aspersions, but however, that such as are so esteemed of by you, have a right to be received into the fellowship of the Saints, these Scriptures prove, which I pray you examine. <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.1. to the 7. <hi>Isai.</hi> 14 32. and 18.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26.27, 28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5.</p>
